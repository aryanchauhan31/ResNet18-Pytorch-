ResNet-18 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed to tackle the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks using skip connections (residuals).
It has 18 layers and is effective for image classification tasks, including the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
